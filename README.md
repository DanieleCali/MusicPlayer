# MusicPlayer
This is a minimal music player created years ago to train the javafx lib. The organization of the code of the project is completly confused and i wanted to try to refactor all the code but this can take me a long time so i think it will remain like this.
The music player works fine on windows.
When the user close the music player, it saves the data in %appdata%.
